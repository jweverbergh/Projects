# Simulation of a Switched Reluctance Motor with Finite Element Method

The goal of this work is to simulate a 2D switched reluctance motor by solving the steady-state Maxwell-Amp√®re equation with the finite element method and the conjugate gradients algorithm (with preconditioning) : 

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left ( \frac{1}{\mu}\frac{\partial a}{\partial x} \right ) + \frac{\partial}{\partial u} \left ( \frac{1}{\mu}\frac{\partial a}{\partial y} \right ) + j_s = 0  $$

where we have

- $a$ : magnetic potential;
- $\mu$ : magnetic permeability;
- $j_s$ : source current.


For details, check out the [report](report.pdf). Unfortunately, the code is not publicly available.
